# Website

Here is my website for a class. I need to include the following CSS website requirements:

Template

The template section must be exactly the same on each page
A header section, marked by <div class=”header”>
A navigation section, marked by <div class=”nav”>
The navigation must be constructed using a bulleted list, and must consist of 3 links. The first link must be “Home.” One of the links must be “Contact,” and another link must be “About” (or “About Me”). Each list item must have a unique id, for example: <li id=”nav_home”>, <li id=”nav_about”>, <li id=”nav_contact”>
A content section, marked by <div class=”content”>
A footer section, marked by <div class=”footer”>
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)

The styles must visually turn the main navigation into a tab-like interface (either horizontal or vertical)
The styles must specify a font family for the body of the document
The styles must include at least one background image. The background image must not visually conflict with the foreground text, and must not contain any important content (such as text).
The styles must specify at least one background color
The styles must specify a hover and focus effect for links using the a:hover and a:focus pseudo classes. There should be one set of effects for the navigation and a different set of effects for all other links
Page-specific styles

Each page must have page-specific styles in the head of the document to make the active tab in the navigation look selected or active. This helps users know where they are within a site by simply looking at the navigation bar. The styles must be consistent, so that no matter which page the user is on, it is obvious by looking at the navigation tabs which link is currently active/selected.

Thanks for your help!
