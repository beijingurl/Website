<p>About five years ago, I thought about getting a dog. Some of my friends didn't think I should with my busy schedule, so I hesitated. But then one day, I went running and saw that there was a festival in Shirlington. It was a dog event with vendors and local non-profits. I passed a booth for <a href="https://luckydoganimalrescue.org/">LuckyDog</a> and learned about how I could be a foster for their animal rescue organization. I thought this was a great way to take care of dogs without the full-time commitment. After going through the paperwork, I was contacted by a volunteer. She came and explained my responsibilities in being a foster parent and made suggestions for taking care of the dog and how I could help him/her get adopted. I couldn't wait to foster a dog!</p>
<p>I showed up at my first adoption event. After much observation, I chose a black lab mix named Sherwood from Florence, South Carolina. He didn't smell too good when I got him, so I immediately gave him a bath. He was very timid and sweet. I took him for walks, and even took him running for a few miles. He was able to keep up with me for three miles! At that point, I knew this was the dog for me!</p>
<p>A couple of days later, I received a call that a couple was interested in adopting him. I was surprised to find myself in tears, and explained to the coordinator that I didn't want to part from Sherwood. And before I knew it, I was a failed foster parent! I found myself adopting him within a week. I later changed his name to <em>Bentley</em>.</p>

<h2>At the Beginning</h2>

<p>When I got Bentley he was about 1 year old.<sup>1.</sup> He was super playful. He loves stuffed animals especially with squeaky toys. He ripped them to shreds and gutted the stuffing out, and always made sure to chew up the squeaky toys. He was teething, so he would destroy many of my things including socks, remote controls, coasters, his bedding, my rug, and even my friend's cell phone. One time, I came out of the shower to put on clothes, only to find holes with teeth marks on them!

<p>Bentley has always had a lot of energy. He would run around in circles at dog parks, corralling other dogs. I suspect he has some border collie in him.With some dogs, he would love to tussle with them, oftentimes nipping at their hind legs. He would bark at them and take their toys away to get their attention. Some dogs didn't like the way he played, so they would bark aggressively at him and vice versa! He needed to learn how to socialize with other dogs appropriately. I considered enrolling him at a nearby doggie daycare, but after a full-day evaluation, they rejected him! They said that maybe he could come back when he was older.</P>
<p>So I decided to go through training with him. It was during those days, I realized how important it was to for us to learn how to communicate with each other (like in all relationships)! With treats in hand, he quickly learned how to sit, come (although he's not always willing to do this), turn around, lay down, and go to spots that I point to. I also managed to teach him some tricks like high five, shake, roll over and play dead. He also quickly learned to do his business outside, and learned that he's not allowed in the kitchen or on furniture.</p>
<p>Now that Bentley is older, he's calmed down <sub>somewhat</sub>. He still sometimes tries to dominate other dogs, but he doesn't play rough like he used to. He's always been good with children. He loves to be around people, and doesn't like to be left alone. I still try to take him for runs and to dog parks as much as I can. He tends to sleep all day at home, so getting out is good for him.</article>

<sup>1.</sup>I think he might've been younger based on his behavior.
